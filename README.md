# Hey, I'm [Josh Pohl](https://www.lightpohl.me).

I’m a software engineer working remotely somewhere in the US.

Some of my code is helping power projects at Yum, Cameo, VICE, the MTA, USAA, and sites like [Yap](https://yap.chat/).

Find me elsewhere on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lightpohl/), or reach out directly via email: [josh@lightpohl.me](mailto:josh@lightpohl.me).
